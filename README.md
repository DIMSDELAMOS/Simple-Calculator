# Java Simple Calculator 🧮

A lightweight command-line calculator built with Java. This project demonstrates basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by separating the logic (`Calculator.java`) from the execution flow (`Main.java`).

## ✨ Features

* Performs basic arithmetic operations:
    * Addition (+)
    * Subtraction (-)
    * Multiplication (*)
    * Division (/)
* Input validation and error handling (e.g., division by zero).
* Clean code structure.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Ensure you have **Java** installed on your machine.
2.  Compile the source files:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java Calculator.java
    ```
3.  Run the program:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## 📂 Project Structure

* `Main.java`: Handles user interaction and input.
* `Calculator.java`: Contains the logic for arithmetic operations.
